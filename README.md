<H1>Games in JavaScript
</H1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p></p>I made this repository to store all the games that I made in JavaScript. I believe that coding games enable you to think more analytically about the game mechanism and they are a great practice to improve your coding skills.
In this repository, I made sure to practice many JavaScript fundamentals such as operations with arrays and objects etc.</p>
